        - it is a behaviour design patteren that define the family of algo
        put each of them in seperate class and make their object is interchangeable


        - problem
        - naviagation app
            - car route
            - bike route
            - so many

          - solution
          - take a class that does something specific things in different ways
             then extract all  the algo and put into seperate class called strategies

          -  orignial class called context - that must have field the storing the
             a refrence to one of the strategies

         - context is responsible for selecting the algo

         -

         application

         - different varient of algo if we used and switch form one algo to another
         during runtime
